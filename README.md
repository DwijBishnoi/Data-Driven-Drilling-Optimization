# Data-Driven-Drilling-Optimization

Key Points:-
1. The project focuses on determining output parameters like MRR, Circularity, Cylindricity, and Delamination Factor.  
2. Started with an initial dataset of 28 datapoints generated from practical work.  
3. Regression formulas were provided but required modifications for better output parameter calculation.  
4. Improved formulas led to data augmentation of about 400 datapoints for training and testing.  
5. Models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and XGBoost were trained.  
6. Key evaluation metrics included:  
   - Training Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3.05124406083866e-07  
   - Testing MSE: 1.607785555739084e-05  
   - Training R² Score: 0.9998039040148634  
   - Testing R² Score: 0.9901063078586306  
7. Plans to add more metrics like MAE, RMSE, and various charts for better performance analysis.  
8. Development of a proposed model using ensemble techniques like XGBoost, MLP, and LSTM for deeper insights.
9. Dataset was further augmented to 1600 datapoints for the proposed model, which will include detailed metrics and visualizations.
